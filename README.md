This place might seem a little empty. That's because I've moved out.

## GitHub is harmful

Under Microsoft's ownership, GitHub no longer serves the goals it was once meant to.

Through acts such as

* [serving fascist organisations like ICE](https://github.com/drop-ice/dear-github-2.0),
* enabling the [genocide in Gaza](https://data.techforpalestine.org/) by [providing the IDF with cloud and AI tools for combat, intelligence and oppression](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/23/israeli-military-gaza-war-microsoft) and by [facilitating total surveillance of Palestinian people](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/microsoft-israeli-military-palestinian-phone-calls-cloud), in spite of [protest](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/19/microsoft-workers-protest-washington-israel) from [Microsoft employees](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/26/microsoft-employee-sit-in-israeli-military-ties),
* [appropriating](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jul/14/welcome-to-guardian-techscape-will-ai-make-centaurs-of-us-all) all kinds of [open source code](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/148571) into the slop machine called Copilot,
* forcing the slop machine [into everyone's faces](https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/05/github_copilot_complaints/), dumping the slop [right back on open source maintainers](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/07/14/death-by-a-thousand-slops/), and telling developers to [_"get out of their career"_](https://www.businessinsider.com/github-ceo-developers-embrace-ai-or-get-out-2025-8),
* making GitHub [directly subservient](https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/11/github_head_ankles_as_microsoft/) to the interests of slop peddling,
* and now [coercing internal teams](https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/29/github_deepens_ties_with_elon/) to integrate Musk's [nazi AI](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/09/grok-ai-praised-hitler-antisemitism-x-ntwnfb) into Copilot, ignoring [community backlash](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/171322),

Microsoft has demonstrated that it is now entirely devoted to death and destruction, both of people's lives, and of the field of software development, and GitHub plays a significant part in that.

It would be unconscionable for me to host my projects on such a platform, when I don't have to, so I won't.

Others, such as the **Software Freedom Conservancy**, have also outlined [why and how to leave GitHub](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/).

I may occasionally send a contribution to an open source project on GitHub - only because I care deeply about the project, _in spite of_ it being hosted here. I will try to advocate for such projects to leave GitHub as well.
